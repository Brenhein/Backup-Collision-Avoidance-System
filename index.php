    <p id="overall">The Backup Collision Avoidance System is responsible for obstacle detection, collision prevention, and damage
        mitigation if an accident were to occur for objects residing behind a vehicle, as they may
        be out of view of the driverâ€™s line-of-sight. While backup systems can be an afterthought
        for many new vehicles, the potential damage that may be caused by accidentally backing into objects or pedestrians warrants a well-designed system, making the BCAS an
        important part of the vehicle. As accident prevention and damage mitigation are both
        high-level goals of vehicles, the system works specifically to prevent unintended collisions
        with pedestrians or objects during the reverse operation of the vehicle.  This prototype highlights
        some of the key use cases of the backup collision avoidance system, allowing the
        user to interact with it and experience some of its functionality.

                    on the left side of the screen, a demonstration of what plays out based on their
                    actions is seen here.

                <dd><b>A pedestrian:</b> The object the car is trying to avoid (must be manually added to the

                <dt><b>Add Obstacles:</b></dt>
                    <dd>Adds a pedestrian to the end of the road. The pedestrian can be added
                        at <b>any time</b> during the backup operation. The later the obstacle is added, the more
                        likely the vehicle is to collide with it. <b>Even after a collision, the vehicle will
                                apply the maximum braking force to mitigate damages in the prototype.</b></dd>

                    <dd>Adds ice to the cameras. As soon as the ice is added, the heat
                    <b>automatically</b> turns on and heats the cameras for 3 seconds, until the ice melts.
                    It can be pressed at any time <b>as long as

                        dependent on the vehicle being in reverse. </dd>
                    <dd><b>Note that in the actual system, only the

                    to clean the cameras. It can be pressed at any time <b>as long as
